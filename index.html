    <p> Hello Everyone! Let me make a brief introduction of myself. My name is Erik and I am 24 years old. I come from a lovely small country called Albania. After finishing my high school I moved to Vienna, Austria to continua my bachelor degree studies.
        There I passed 5 of the most beautiful years of my life. I meet the love of my life and also got a little dog named Bambi. Last year we decided to move to Toronto, Canada for some work experience. Until now we have had an amaizing time in this dynamic amaizing city.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        During my free time I enjoy traveling and exploring new places and different cultures.
            <br>
            <br>
            

        Some of my hobbies include computer programming and skiing. The last one i have been doing it for the past 10 years.
